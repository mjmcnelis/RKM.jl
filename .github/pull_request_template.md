# Checks
<!--
The goal of the checks is for the person(s) who review your code to know you've
produced quality code before you've asked them to review it.

Please check all that apply in the bullet-point list below. Unchecked items imply you have
not done them, and so an explanation as to why not is recommend. You can add "N/A" next to
the boxes if they are in fact no relevant.
